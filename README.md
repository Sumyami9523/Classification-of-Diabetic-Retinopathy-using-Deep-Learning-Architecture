# Classification-of-Diabetic-Retinopathy-using-Deep-Learning-Architecture
Diabetic individuals experience ophthalmological distress known as diabetic retinopathy as a result of blood clots, lesions, or hemorrhage development in the retina's light-sensitive area. As blood sugar levels rise, blocked blood arteries cause new blood vessels to develop, giving rise to structures that look similar to a mesh. Evaluation of retinal vasculature branches must be done by opthalmologists in order to provide accurate diagnosis. Pre-processing is applied to the retina scans of the eye before segmentation. The maximum eigen values are taken from the hessian matrix which is used by the maximum principal curvature approach for extracting the blood vessel branches from retinal scans. Then, morphological opening and Adaptive Histogram Equalisation are carried out to improve and remove incorrectly segmented sections. When compared to healthy people, diabetes or afflicted patients showed a substantially larger proliferation of optical nerves. The general CNN architecture with necessary layers is used for the classification of scans as normal or abnormal. When tested on the DIARETDB1 dataset , the proposed model produced results with a precision and accuracy of 97.1% and 97.2%, respectively.
